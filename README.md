# My Personal Website

This is my personal website.

it has 4 pages.
index = home
about = bio
contact = a form that should open the users email, set up currently with a dummy demo account.
projects = this is a placekeeper for future projects
services = html this is a bit of blurb with flex grid containing skills

The site has a favicon.
The social media links through to social media pages
I tried to use Java script to make a hamburger menu on the mobile site. The hamburger menu only appears if the screen is small. I cant seem to get the script to run when select the hamburger menu.

If you turn the mobile screen to horizontal the normal nav menu will appear.
